# SectionsAndItems

## Requirements

1. **Infinity Feed**:
   - The main screen should feature a scrollable infinity feed comprising sections and items within those sections.
   
2. **Random Background Colors**:
   - Each section should have a unique, random background color to be easily distinguishable.

3. **Variable Number of Items**:
   - Each section can contain a varying number of items, ranging from 1 to 10.

4. **Full Screen Item Content**:
   - Each itemâ€™s content should occupy the full screen, with paginated scrolling enabled within the scroll view.

5. **Appending New Sections**:
   - New sections should be added to the end of the feed over time.

6. **Scroll Navigation**:
   - Users can scroll back to the previous item within a section but cannot scroll back to a previous section.

7. **Progress Indicator**:
   - A visible indicator should always be present on the screen, displaying the number of sections completed and the maximum seen item index in the current section, formatted as: `Sections completed: 0, item 1 / 4`.
